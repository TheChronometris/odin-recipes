This is a test site for The Odin Project. This will be used as an experiment to practice basic HTML
elements, such as boilerplate set-up, proper use of headers, paragraphs, unordered lists, unordered lists,
image linking, and relative address linking. 

The idea of this site is to be a recipe website that links to multiple recipe pages within the repository,
showcasing the recipe itself, as well as ingredients and steps. 

By the end, I will have demonstrated basic HTML use to create a simple, but functional multipage site.
