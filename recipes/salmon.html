            <p>Here is a recipe I discoverd on <a href="https://cafedelites.com/">Cafe Delites</a> that I use as a baseline for preparing 
            fresh salmon with any sides of choice. Their recipe suggests <strong>skin-off</strong> salmon fillets,
            but if you prefer <strong>skin-on</strong> fillets (as I do) then this recipe still works with no adjustments.
            This recipe is very simple and takes very little time to prepare and cook (10-15 minutes total), but is still packed with flavor. 
            Be sure to have any sides you plan on having prepared in advanced. Below are the list of ingredients and step-by-step 
            instructions to the perfect seared salmon and delicious garlic butter sauce. Hope you enjoy!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Dry room temperature salmon filets with paper towel.</li>
            <li>Season all over with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick pan or skillet over medium-high heat until hot.</li>
            <li>Sear salmon <strong>flesh side down</strong>, 
                pressing them lightly so the entire surface of the flesh comes into contact with the pan, 
                until crispy and golden. </li>
            <li>Flip and sear the other side until the outside is crispy.</li>
            <li>Add in the butter, garlic, parsley and lemon juice,
                stirring the melting butter around each fillet. (The butter will begin to brown slightly.)</li>
