    <p>Are you ready for a simple, tasty, and incredibly cheap 5-ingredient chili recipe? Great for those winter days
        when you want something to warm you up, for game day, or as a bulk meal to last you a few days when you don't feel like
        cooking, as this is recipe is done in a crock pot/slow cooker. This recipe calls for ground turkey, 
        but you can always substitute your protein of choice. We will be using cans of "Diced Tomato with green chile" as the base 
        of this dish. Use your preferred brand, and you can use the fire roasted variety if you want that extra flavor profile!
        This is a foundation to add anything you like, especially your own seasonings, so I will not 
        go into much depth on other spices to add other than chili poweder
        and leave the rest to your imagination/interpretation. Wihtout further delay, the ingredients
        and instructions are below.
